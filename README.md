# PrimeTrade Sentiment Assignment Package

This folder mirrors the standardized submission layout and contains everything needed to regenerate the analysis inside Google Colab without calling external apps or front-end code.

## Structure
- `notebook_1.ipynb` – primary Colab workflow (data prep, feature engineering, clustering, models, and strategy diagnostics).
- `notebook_2.ipynb` – optional leverage/sentiment deep-dive that reuses the CSV outputs generated by Notebook 1.
- `csv_files/` – source data (`fear_greed_index.csv`, `historical_data.csv`) plus derived tables (rankings, clusters, regime metrics, leverage alerts, feature correlations, etc.).
- `outputs/` – visual assets exported by Notebook 1 (`sentiment_performance_heatmap.png` seeded; add others as needed).
- `ds_report.pdf` / `ds_report.txt` – comprehensive narrative ready for submission.
- `requirements.txt` – dependency list for `pip install`.

## Run the Project in Google Colab
1. **Upload the folder**  
   - Compress `ds_Advay_Sinha` or upload it directly to Google Drive (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/ds_Advay_Sinha`).  
   - Ensure sharing permissions are set to *Anyone with the link can view* for each notebook before submission.

2. **Open `notebook_1.ipynb` in Colab**  
   - Runtime → Change runtime type → Python 3.  
   - Update the `DATA_ROOT` variable if your folder is stored in a different Drive path, then execute the remaining cells in order.  
   - The notebook loads the CSVs, engineers sentiment-aware features, merges trades with sentiment (72h tolerance), clusters trader archetypes, trains Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Gradient Boosting / XGBoost classifiers, evaluates sentiment-driven strategies, and saves fresh CSV/JSON/PNG outputs back into `csv_files/` and `outputs/`.

3. **Open `notebook_2.ipynb` (optional)**  
   - Confirms Notebook 1 outputs exist and then explores trader leverage, ROI, and sentiment alignment using the regenerated CSVs.  
   - Useful for crafting personalized notes or screenshots for the report.

4. **Refresh the report**  
   - After running the notebooks, update `ds_report.pdf` / `ds_report.txt` with any new findings and re-export additional visuals into `outputs/` if needed.
