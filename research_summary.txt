Market sentiment behaves like a pressure gauge for traders. Greed regimes draw capital into high-beta longs and bolder leverage, whereas fear forces rapid deleveraging and flatter positioning. By overlaying trader performance on the Fear & Greed Index we see two hidden patterns: (1) trend followers compound gains when sentiment drifts from Neutral into Greed, and (2) contrarian specialists quietly accumulate edge when extreme fear sparks forced liquidations. Smarter strategies therefore embrace regime-aware playbooks: lean into momentum while sentiment is stable or rising, fade euphoric extremes with tighter risk, and tighten risk controls around accounts whose leverage range spikes during sentiment shocks. Hidden pattern watch: trend desks outperform when sentiment slopes upward for several sessions, while contrarian desks monetize the snap-backs that follow extreme readings. Predictive suite: GradientBoosting leads with accuracy 91.7% and ROC 96.0%, proving sentiment-aware signals are learnable. Strategy diagnostics: Contrarian Extremes (Sharpe -4.95, Sortino -4.83); Trend Following (Sharpe 3.17, Sortino 8.12); Leverage Scaling (Sharpe 3.59, Sortino 7.68).
